# GitHubSortByVotes

Here's what I propose:

ask Fryd for tips on accessing the API and her script to automatically update her site every hour
consider using the stock Jekyll GH Pages template
consider how to update the Jekyll using a script likely hosted on GCP, possibly a simple Cloud Function
understand the API calls to retrieve the number of likes per issue, and sort the issues in an HTML scriptable (JS?) table or iframe.
likely sort using Cloud Function to create an http linkable iframe to use in a static GitHub Page.
write up the instructions and template script in the repo above
Anyone who would like to see this as a standardized tool for easily visualizing GH issue based on their userbase's demand, by all means please jump in! Thanks!

And thanks Fyrd (https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse/issues/2408) for bringing this new functionality to my attention.. have been waiting quite a while to be able to sort GH issues in a more readable format than using sort on GH.
